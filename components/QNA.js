                                <p>Guru ts is blessed with the power for shaktipat which awakens the kundalini Shakti of the spiritual aspirant. Guru gives Shaktipat Diksha through a divine word (Mantra). It includes two things to be done by any seeker Mantra chanting and Meditation.Sit in a comfortable position facing any direction.You can sit cross legged on the floor or on a chair or lie down in case unable to sit.Look at Guru s image for a minute.Then close your eyes and try to see Guru s image at the centre of your forehead and silently pray to Guru s to help you meditate for 15-30 minutes. Mentally chant the mantra given by Guru ( without moving your lips and tongue ) while meditating. During this period, if you undergo any type of yogic exercises ,do not panic.Let it happen. Do not try to stop them.These yogic postures are a part of your inner cleansing.These will stop once the requested time period of meditation is over. Meditate in this way for 15 minutes in the morning and evening with an empty stomach.</p>

                                <p>The chanting of Mantra becomes automatic when it is repeated continuously over a certain period of time. This however depends directly on the degree of intensity, faith and sincerity with which the chanting is done. In some cases the chanting becomes automatic just over a week while some other cases it takes a fortnight or even few months. The practitioner is strongly advised not to give up if he/she finds the progress to be slow. He/she will eventually catch up.</p>

                                <p>The divine mantra given by Guru is secret. DO NOT reveal the Secret Mantra to anyone even if the person happens to be your close relation such as husband, wife, child or parent. Although the Mantra is given in an open public session, divine law restricts the practitioner from passing it on to others or saying it loudly. Violation of this code renders the mantra ineffective, and the erring practitioner cannot hope to benefit from the practice of Yoga during his entire life time nor does he/she receive blessings and Grace of Guru.</p>
